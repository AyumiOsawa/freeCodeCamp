// BREADTH FIRST SEARCH
//
// Write a function bfs() that takes an adjacency matrix graph
// (a two-dimensional array) and a node label root as parameters. The node
// label will just be the integer value of the node between 0 and n - 1, where
// n is the total number of nodes in the graph.
//
// Your function will output a JavaScript object key-value pairs with the node
// and its distance from the root. If the node could not be reached, it should
// have a distance of Infinity.
